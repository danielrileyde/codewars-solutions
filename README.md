Introduction

CodeWars is a platform that provides coding challenges (kata) of varying difficulty levels ranging from beginner (8kyu) to expert (1kyu). This repository serves as a collection of my solutions to these challenges. Feel free to explore the solutions and provide feedback or improvements.
Folder Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

lua

/

Each kata has its own folder containing the solution file(s). Additionally, a README file may be included for more detailed explanations or notes regarding the solution.
